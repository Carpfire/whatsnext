Hello Welcome to my blog. This plog is named Janky Blog, because it is super Janky at the time of me writing this. Maybe someday it will get better, maybe it will be a perpetual list of links to posts. The purpose of this blog was not to code a blog, but to blog itself. Even "to blog" sounds wrong, this is realistically more of a brain dump where I try to present things I am thinking about as though to an audience. Hopefully by trying to take the mess of ideas and thoughts swimming around in my head and presenting them I will learn a lot myself. I am also writing this blog because I like blogs. Blogs, at least the type that I read, are such a pure form of individual expression. I don't think most people set out writing a blog with the intention of making money or gaining noteriety, if they do their blog is probably bad, rather they just want to share and refine their ideas. Having relatively passively consumed this form of media for a while now, I wish to be a more active participant in this things that I have come to like.
