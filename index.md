## Welcome to what's next a brain dump for myself in the form of a blog
Here at what's next we like to believe that doing is better than observing. A piece of advice I too often fail to do. Since I enjoy the whole "Blogosphere" or whatever I figured I would follow this creed and join in. Shout out to github pages for making this ridiculously easy. 


Were just gonna list posts in the Jankiest possible format for a while while I figure stuff out.
